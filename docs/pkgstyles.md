# apkg packaging styles

In order to support different packaging formats, tools, and systems, `apkg` introduces concept of **packaging style**. Each packaging style in `apkg.pkgstyles` such as `deb`, `rpm`, or `arch` contains common functions to perform packaging on a corresponding packaging platform.

`apkg.pkgstyle` module provides discovery of individual packaging styles which are in turn used to handle packaging on target distro by `apkg` commands such as `apkg srcpkg` and `apkg build`.

This means that all platform specific code is contained in separate files (`arch.py`, `deb.py`, `rpm.py`) which are maintained independently. Breakage in `apkg.pkgstyles.rpm` will only affect builds on `rpm` platforms. New packaging styles can be added easily, external plugin support is planned.

When needed by `apkg`, packaging style is chosen based on target distro string as provided by python [distro module](https://pypi.org/project/distro/) or specified through `--distro` CLI option.

Each `pkgstyle` provides `SUPPORTED_DISTROS` list and single packaging style is chosen automatically to match target distro.
